Are you dealing with video conferences with many users, trying to setup your own Meerkat/Periscope, or just want to get WebRTC's various codecs to work together? You're going to need to do some media processing. Emil Ivov from Atlassian walks you through the why and how.

This session is from an afternoon of talks by WebRTC experts, including updates from Google, Mozilla and Microsoft. The event took place at the Google office in San Francisco. More details at http://krankygeek.com.
