title: "Core Header Panel"
description: "The core-header-panel is a great next step after you've mastered some of the other elements like core-icon and core-toolbar. With core-header-panel we can control the scroll behavior of our page and combine it with other elements, like core-toolbar, to compose app-like UIs. In this video we'll not only get a core-header-panel to show up, but we'll also discuss the power of composition and how Web Components make it super easy."
