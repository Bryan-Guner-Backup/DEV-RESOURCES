<p class="intro">
Focus your mobile homepage on connecting users to the content they’re looking for.

## 1. Keep calls to action front and center

Make secondary tasks available through [menus](/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/responsive/) or “below the fold” 
(the part of the webpage that can’t be seen without scrolling down).

<div class="mdl-grid">
  <figure class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <img src="images/hpnav-cta-good.png">
    <figcaption class="wf-figcaption-good">Do: make all of your users’ most common tasks easily available.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <img src="images/hpnav-cta-bad.png">
    <figcaption class="wf-figcaption-bad">Don’t: waste precious above-the-fold space with vague calls-to-action like “learn more”.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

## 2. Keep menus short and sweet

Mobile users don’t have the patience to scroll through a long list of options to find what they want. Reorganize your menu to use as few items as possible, without sacrificing usability.

<div class="mdl-grid">
  <figure class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <img src="images/hpnav-menus-good.png">
    <figcaption class="wf-figcaption-good">Do: keep menus short and sweet.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

## 3. Make it easy to get back to the home page

Users expect to go back to the homepage when they tap the logo in the top-left of a mobile page, and they become frustrated when it isn’t available, or doesn’t work.

<div class="mdl-grid">
  <figure class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <img src="images/hpnav-hp-good.png">
    <figcaption class="wf-figcaption-good">Do: make it easy to get back to the home page.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

## 4. Don't let promotions steal the show

Large app install interstitials (e.g. full-page promotions that hide content and prompt users to install an app) annoy users and make it difficult to perform tasks. On top of annoying users, sites that use app install interstitials fail the [Google Mobile-Friendly Test](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/), which may negatively impact their search rankings.

<div class="mdl-grid">
  <figure class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <img src="images/hpnav-promo-good.png">
    <figcaption class="wf-figcaption-good">Do: Promotions should be easily dismissable and not distract from the experience.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <img src="images/hpnav-promo-bad.png">
    <figcaption class="wf-figcaption-bad">Don’t: Interstitials (sometimes called door slams) often annoy users and make using the site a pain.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
