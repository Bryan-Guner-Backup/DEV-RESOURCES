## 5. Make site search visible

Users looking for information usually turn to search, so the search field should be one of the first things they see on your pages. Don’t hide the search box in a menu.

<div class="mdl-grid">
  <figure class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <img src="images/ss-search-good.jpg">
    <figcaption class="wf-figcaption-good">Do: Make search visible</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <img src="images/ss-search-bad.jpg">
    <figcaption class="wf-figcaption-bad">Don't: Hide search in overflow menus</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

## 6. Ensure site search results are relevant

Users don’t scan through multiple pages of results to find what they’re looking for. Make life easier on users by auto-completing queries, correcting misspellings, and suggesting related queries. Rather than reinventing the wheel, consider robust products like [Google Custom Search](https://cse.google.com/cse/).


<div class="mdl-grid">
  <figure class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <img src="images/ss-relevant-good.png" alt="Site with relevant search results">
    <figcaption class="wf-figcaption-good">Do: Macy's returns only kids items.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <img src="images/ss-relevant-bad.png" alt="Search returning irrelevant results">
    <figcaption class="wf-figcaption-bad">Don't: Return results for anything with the word kid in it.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

## 7. Implement filters to narrow results

Study participants rely on [filters](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/structured_search) to find what they’re looking for, and abandon sites that do not have effective filters. Place filters above search results, and help users by displaying how many results will be returned when a specific filter is applied.

<div class="mdl-grid">
  <figure class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <img src="images/ss-filters-good.jpg">
    <figcaption class="wf-figcaption-good">Do: Make it easy to filter</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <img src="images/ss-filters-bad.jpg">
    <figcaption class="wf-figcaption-bad">Don't: Hide filter functionality.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

## 8. Guide users to better site search results

For sites with diverse customer segments, ask a few questions before presenting the search box and use the customer’s responses as search query filters to ensure that users get results from the most relevant segment.

<div class="mdl-grid">
  <figure class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <img src="images/ss-guide-good.png" srcset="images/ss-guide-good.png 1x, images/ss-guide-good-2x.png 2x" alt="Zappos guides users by asking them what they're looking for.">
    <figcaption class="wf-figcaption-good">Do: help users to find what they're looking for by guiding them in the right direction.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
