Understand your customer journeys and let users convert on their own terms.

## 9. Let users explore before they commit

Study participants were frustrated by sites that require upfront registrations to view the site, especially when the brand was unfamiliar. Although customer information may be integral to your business, asking for it too early may result in fewer registrations.

## 10. Let users purchase as a guest

Study participants viewed guest checkouts as “convenient”, “simple”, “easy”, and “quick”. Users are annoyed by sites that force them to register for an account when making a purchase, especially when the benefit of an account is unclear.

## 11. Use existing information to maximize convenience

Remember and [pre-fill preferences](/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/input/forms/label-and-name-inputs) for registered users. Offer familiar, third-party checkout services for new users.

## 12. Use click-to-call buttons for complex tasks

On devices with calling capabilities, [click-to-call links](/web/fundamentals/native-hardware/click-to-call/) enable users to make a phone call by simply tapping a link. On most mobile devices the user receives a confirmation before the number is dialed, or a menu is presented asking the user how the number should be handled.

## 13. Make it easy to finish on another device

Users frequently want to finish tasks on other devices. For instance, they might wish to view an item on a larger screen. Or they might get busy and need to finish later. Support these customer journeys by enabling users to [share items on social networks](/web/fundamentals/discovery-and-monetization/social-discovery/), or by letting users email themselves links from directly within the site.
