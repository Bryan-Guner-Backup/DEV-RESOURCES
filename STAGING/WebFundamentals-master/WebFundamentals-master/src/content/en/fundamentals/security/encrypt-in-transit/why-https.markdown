You should always protect all of your websites with HTTPS,
even if they don’t handle sensitive communications. HTTPS provides
critical security and data integrity both for your websites and for the
people that entrust your websites with their personal information.

## HTTPS protects the integrity of your website 

HTTPS helps prevent intruders from tampering with the communications 
between your websites and your users’ browsers. Intruders include 
intentionally malicious attackers, and legitimate but intrusive companies, 
such as ISPs or hotels that inject ads into pages.

Intruders exploit unprotected communications to trick your users into giving 
up sensitive information or installing malware, or to insert their own 
advertisements into your resources. For example, some third-parties inject 
advertisements into websites that potentially break user experiences and 
create security vulnerabilities.

Intruders exploit every unprotected resource that travels between your 
websites and your users. Images, cookies, scripts, HTML… they’re all 
exploitable. Intrusions can occur at any point in the network, including a 
user’s machine, a Wi-Fi hotspot, or a compromised ISP, just to name a few. 

## HTTPS protects the privacy and security of your users

HTTPS prevents intruders from being able to passively listen in on the 
communications between your websites and your users.

One common misconception about HTTPS is the belief that the only websites 
that need HTTPS are those that handle sensitive communications. Every 
unprotected HTTP request can potentially reveal information about the 
behaviors and identities of your users. Although a single visit to one of 
your unprotected websites may seem benign, some intruders look at the 
aggregate browsing activities of your users to make inferences about their 
behaviors and intentions, and to 
[de-anonymize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-anonymization)
their identities. For example, 
employees might inadvertently disclose sensitive health conditions to their 
employers just by reading unprotected medical articles.

## HTTPS is the future of the web

Powerful, new web platform features, such as taking pictures or recording 
audio with getUserMedia, or enabling offline app experiences with Service 
Workers, require explicit permission from the user before executing. Many 
older APIs are also being updated to require permission to execute, such as 
the 
[geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation) 
API. HTTPS is a key component to the permission workflows 
for both these new features and updated APIs.
