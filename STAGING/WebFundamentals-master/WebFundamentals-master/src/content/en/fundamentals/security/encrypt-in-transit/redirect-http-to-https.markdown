Set `<link rel="canonical" href="https://â€¦"/>` tags in your pages. [This
helps search engines](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en)
know the best way to get to your site.

Most web servers offer a simple redirect feature. Use `301 (Moved Permanently)` to
indicate to search engines and browsers that the HTTPS version is canonical and redirect your users to the HTTPS version of your site from HTTP.
