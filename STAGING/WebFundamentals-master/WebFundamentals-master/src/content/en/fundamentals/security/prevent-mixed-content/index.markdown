<p class="intro">
  <b>Mixed content</b> refers to a webpage where the initial HTML content is loaded 
  over a secure HTTPS connection, but other resources (such as 
  images, videos, stylesheets, scripts) are then loaded over an insecure HTTP connection. This is called mixed 
  content because both HTTP and HTTPS content are being loaded to display the same 
  page, and the initial request was secure over HTTPS. Modern browsers display 
  warnings about this type of content to indicate to the user that this page 
  contains insecure resources.
