If you have followed along with the descriptions and explanations, and have made the recommended changes to the original project code, you should now have an app that runs at a smooth 60fps without any jank in its animations.

## What did we cover?

In this codelab, we covered:

* **Prerequisite knowledge:** critical rendering path, frames and frame rate, application life cycle, and Chrome DevTools
* **An overview of jank:** what it is, why it occurs, and how to visually identify it
* **The project app:** what it's meant to do, why it fails to achieve smooth animations, and how to find and fix the problems

## What are the takeaways?

The main takeaways from this codelab are:

* Janky screen animation can be both a design problem and a code problem.
* The perception of jank -- or the lack of it -- is an important factor in user decisions about whether to use an app.
* Even minor speed adjustments can greatly improve an app's overall performance over time.

## What's next?

We recommend that you examine the completed project code, available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/news-aggregator/tree/solution). You will find that it contains more improved code than this codelab had time to cover. Compare the "before" and "after" versions of the app and explore the code differences to see what else the authors changed to improve the app's performance.

## Thank you!

Thanks for working through this codelab. We're always striving to improve; if you found a bug of problem, or just have suggestions or comments, please contact us at the feedback link. Happy coding!
