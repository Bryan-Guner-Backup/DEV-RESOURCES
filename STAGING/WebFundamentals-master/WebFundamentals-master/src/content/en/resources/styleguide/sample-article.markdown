<p class="intro">
  This is the intro paragraph. It's the equivalent of the old 
  <code>introduction</code> yaml attribute, but instead of living in the YAML 
  front matter, it now lives in the document. It's a simple 
  <code>&lt;p class="intro"&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</code>. There is one funky bit 
  here, because the content is wrapped in a p tag, you <b>cannot</b> use 
  markdown in here and need to use HTML for any of your elements.

## YAML Front Matter

All documents need to have a minimum set of YAML front matter. We've tried to simplify the YAML front matter and now need significantly less than we did before.

## Grids

The [Material Design Lite grid component](http://www.getmdl.io/components/index.html#layout-section/grid) 
is a simplified method for laying out content for multiple screen sizes. It 
reduces the usual coding burden required to correctly display blocks of content
in a variety of display conditions.

{% highlight html %}
<div class="mdl-grid">
  <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <!-- content goes here -->
  </div>
  <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <!-- content goes here -->
  </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

## Images

Wrap images in `<figure>` blocks, and ideally, use responsive images with the
`scrset` attribute when possible. Be sure you include `alt` attributes for your
images as well.

If it makes sense, use the `<figcaption>` tag to provide a caption for the image.

<figure>
  <img src="images/sample.png" alt="sample image">
  <figcaption>This caption should be used to describe the image.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Do and Do not examples

Add the class `wf-figcaption-good` or `wf-figcaption-bad` to the figure caption
to indicate a good or bad example.

<div class="mdl-grid">
  <figure class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <img src="images/sample.png">
    <figcaption class="wf-figcaption-good">Do: add the wf-figcaption-good.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">
    <img src="images/sample.png">
    <figcaption class="wf-figcaption-bad">Don't: add the wf-figcaption-bad.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
