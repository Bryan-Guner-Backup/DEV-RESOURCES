The [Page Visibility API](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2011/06/Page-Visibility-API-Have-I-got-your-attention) can be used to check if the current tab is visible or not. [Sam Dutton](http://twitter.com/@sw12) has thrown together a nice demo highlighting one great use case for the API: pausing a playing HTML5 video if the user switches tabs.

[Demo](http://www.samdutton.com/pageVisibility/)

The demo requires Chrome 13 or higher but could be adapted to work with the upcoming IE10, which will include [support](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/hh272906) for the Page Visibility API.
