Did you know the Elements Panel has a <em>Breadcrumb trail</em>? It can help you trace your steps when you navigate the DOM.


In Canary, you can enable the <em>Material Design</em> experiment. A few nice things:

<ul>
<li>The breadcrumb trail looks better from a visual point of view.</li>
<li>The trail has improved visibility with it being nearer to the top, rather than at the bottom where it is easy to forget about.</li>
<li>Overall, the DevTools UI feels more consistent.</li>
</ul>

Don't forget, you can click each "crumb" within the breadcrumb trail. Doing this highlights the relevant DOM node in the DOM tree view.
